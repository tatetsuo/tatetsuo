# Hi there  [![Bulbasaur](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/black-white/anim/normal/bulbasaur.gif)](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/bulbasaur)   

Hi there! I'm a Computer Technician with a strong focus on hardware, but I also enjoy programming in my spare time. I mainly work with R and Python to keep my data manipulation skills sharp. From time to time, I dive into SQL for database-related projects.

Outside of tech, I'm a fan of gaming—Valorant and Pokémon are some of my favorites! Feel free to check out my projects, and don't hesitate to get in touch if you want to collaborate or chat about tech or games!

I’m a passionate Computer Technician with a deep focus on hardware, specializing in computer and notebook maintenance. Over the years, I’ve gained experience working with both individuals and businesses, providing technical support and troubleshooting solutions. I’m constantly fascinated by the evolution of hardware technology, and I always strive to enhance my knowledge by experimenting with new configurations and setups in my own systems.

In addition to my hardware expertise, I also enjoy programming in my free time, particularly with R and Python, to stay sharp in data manipulation and analysis. I’ve even had the opportunity to serve as a teaching assistant for the R discipline at university, where I helped fellow students deepen their understanding of data science. Occasionally, I also work with SQL for database-related tasks.

Always eager to learn, I find joy in exploring new technologies and improving my skills. Whether it’s maintaining hardware or developing data-driven solutions, I approach each challenge with enthusiasm and precision.
